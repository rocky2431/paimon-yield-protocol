# Research Reports

This directory contains research reports generated by `/ultra-research` command.

## Structure

Research reports are organized by date and round:

- `problem-discovery-{date}.md` - Problem analysis (Round 1)
- `solution-exploration-{date}.md` - Solution comparison (Round 2)
- `tech-evaluation-{date}.md` - Technology selection (Round 3)
- `risk-assessment-{date}.md` - Risk analysis (Round 4)

## Usage

When you run `/ultra-research`, the ultra-research-agent will automatically save its findings here. These reports serve as:

1. **Decision Record** - Why certain technical choices were made
2. **Knowledge Base** - Team learning and expertise capture
3. **Onboarding Material** - Help new team members understand context

## Integration

- Reports are referenced in `specs/architecture.md` for technology decisions
- ADRs in `../decisions/` may link to research reports as supporting evidence
